# BoardGameDiceV3
 Imagine you are playing a board game. You roll a 6-faced dice and move forward the same number of spaces that you rolled. If the finishing point is “n” spaces away from the starting point, please implement a program that calculates how many possible ways there are to arrive exactly at the finishing point.
